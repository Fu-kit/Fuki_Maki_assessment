Question 1: AI as a Programming Partner

Q)Describe two distinct ways you could use an AI tool during the "Understand" and "Identify Input/Output" phases of our six-step programming methodology. Provide specific example prompts and expected outputs.

A)Regarding the two distinct ways to utilize AI tools during the "Understanding" and "Input/Output Identification" phases, in other words: ① There is a phase for understanding the problem and ② a phase for understanding what goes in and what comes out. ① In the first phase, it's necessary to ask the AI "what exactly is being requested" and "what difficult situations might arise." This is because it helps reveal implicit requirements and preconditions that cannot be explicitly interpreted from the problem statement. ② In the second phase, it's necessary to have the AI provide examples of inputs and outputs. This is because it helps in dealing with extreme cases (invalid inputs or abnormal values).

Q)Explain why using AI in these early stages is beneficial, and what potential pitfalls you need to be aware of. How does this align with the "thinking" aspect of programming (programming = thinking + planning + coding)?

A)Even if I ask AI from the early stages, I don’t know what the problem is or what kind of questions I should ask. This is what I consider a potential pitfall.
As a countermeasure to this problem, I ask the AI, 'Please help me understand the problem' and 'Please provide appropriate example questions.
