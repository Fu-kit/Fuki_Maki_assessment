**Test Strategy and Key Points to Keep in Mind**

### 1. Preparation (10 minutes)

**Environment Setup**
Ensure Google Colab and GitHub are connected properly. Initialize your repository and create the folder `lastname_firstname_assessment`, following the specified directory structure.

**AI Tool Setup**
Check that tools like ChatGPT and Copilot are available. Practice how to save conversation logs (e.g., by pasting them into markdown files).

**Points to Keep in Mind**

* Strictly follow the required repository structure and submission requirements.
* Reconfirm the AI usage policy, making sure AI is treated as a *supporting tool*, not a replacement.

---

### 2. Section 1: Short Answer Questions (20 minutes)

**Question 1: How to Use AI (7 minutes)**

**Example Use Cases**

* *Understanding phase*: Ask AI, “List the requirements for a Python temperature conversion program,” to clarify inputs/outputs.
* *Identifying I/O*: Ask, “What error handling is missing from this specification?”

**Benefits & Pitfalls**
AI can help identify issues early, but you must double-check the requirements yourself to avoid overreliance.

---

**Question 2: Debugging (8 minutes)**

**Error Identification**
Points out `ZeroDivisionError` when processing an empty list.

**Example AI Prompt**
“This code throws an error with an empty list. How should I fix it? Please explain the reasoning and suggest edge cases.”

**Fixing Approach**
Add a conditional check: `if len(numbers) == 0:`.

---

**Question 3: Data Structures (5 minutes)**

* **Scenario A**: Use a dictionary (`{'name': grade}`) for efficient access.
* **Scenario B**: Use sets (`set()`) to track submitted students and avoid duplicates.

**Points to Keep in Mind**

* Clearly explain your reasoning and refer to concepts learned in class (e.g., O(1) access with dictionaries).
* Don’t blindly adopt AI suggestions—justify your own choices.

---

### 3. Section 2: Implementation Problems (35 minutes)

**Problem 1: Temperature Conversion (20 minutes)**

**Understand & Plan (3 minutes)**
Define inputs (temperature, unit) and outputs (converted result). Ask AI how to validate user input.

**Pseudocode (5 minutes)**

```python
if not input.isdigit():
    print("Invalid input")
elif unit not in ['C', 'F']:
    ...
```

**Implementation (12 minutes)**
Use `try-except` for numeric input. Simplify regular expressions proposed by AI for better readability.

---

**Problem 2: Quiz System (15 minutes)**

**Data Structure**
Use a list of dictionaries:

```python
[{'question': ..., 'options': [...], 'answer': 'A'}]
```

**AI Usage**
Ask: “What’s an efficient way to implement the scoring logic for a multiple-choice quiz?” Improve the loop based on AI suggestions.

**Points to Keep in Mind**

* Document conversations with AI and explain why you chose specific code structures (e.g., “I used `if-else` instead of `match-case` due to readability”).
* Include test cases for edge inputs like blank answers or boundary values.

---

### 4. Section 3: Reflection (5 minutes)

**Evaluating AI Interaction**
“In `temperature_development.md`, AI’s suggestion to layer exception handling was helpful. However, I avoided overgeneralization and focused on assessment-specific logic.”

**Revision Example**
“In `quiz_design.md`, I removed the randomization feature AI suggested because it was outside the scope of the requirements.”

**Key Reminder**
Keep reflections concise and reference specific files.

---

### 5. Final Checks (10 minutes)

**Checklist**

* All code runs correctly in Colab.
* AI logs include evidence of iterative learning (e.g., prompt revisions).
* Reflections clearly express what was learned.

**Final Review**
Add a strategy summary to `README.md`, such as:
“I used AI for brainstorming, but prioritized course best practices during implementation.”

---

### Summary

* **Time Allocation**: Planning (20%) → Implementation (50%) → Testing & Reflection (30%)
* **AI Usage**: Always be ready to explain why you accepted or rejected a suggestion.
* **Documentation**: Make your thought process visible to meet the “AI Integration & Methodology” assessment criteria.

**Test Composition Summary**

This task involves instructions and evaluation methods for a Python programming test. It is a two-hour open-book format with AI usage (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) encouraged. I need to provide students with effective test-taking procedures and key points to be mindful of.

---

### Test Sections:

* **Section 1:** Short-answer and conceptual understanding (20 minutes)
* **Section 2:** AI-assisted problem-solving and implementation (35 minutes)
* **Section 3:** Reflection (5 minutes)

---

### Special Emphasis:

* Document AI conversations and show your learning process
* Follow the six-step programming methodology
* Explain not only *what* you did, but *why* you chose that approach
* Use AI as a tool to **enhance** learning—not just to get the right answer

---

## Test-Taking Strategy and Key Considerations

### 1. Pre-Test Setup

* Prepare your Google Colab and GitHub accounts
* Ensure your programming environment is functional
* Review the six-step problem-solving framework (Understand → Identify I/O → Manual Work → Pseudocode → Implement → Test)

### 2. Time Allocation

* Section 1: Short answer & conceptual understanding (20 min)
* Section 2: Problem-solving & implementation (35 min):

  * Temperature converter (20 min)
  * Quiz system (15 min)
* Section 3: Reflection (5 min)
* Remaining time: Prepare for submission (GitHub cleanup, etc.)

### 3. Effective AI Interaction (Throughout)

* Don’t just request answers—use AI conversationally
* Ask: “How should I approach this problem?” not “Write code for me.”
* Follow up with questions to deepen understanding
* Record the entire conversation (screenshots or copied text)
* Critically evaluate AI suggestions
* Ask “What if...” questions to explore edge cases and exceptions

### 4. Key Points in Each Step

#### Understand & Plan

* Rephrase the problem in your own words and check with AI
* Define input/output clearly and validate with AI
* Think about edge cases and discuss them with AI

#### Implementation

* Build code in stages—not all at once
* Ask AI, “Why did you suggest this?”
* Connect AI proposals with course concepts
* Read, understand, and modify AI comments

#### Testing

* Test not only standard cases but also edge cases (e.g., empty lists, negative values)
* Ask AI why an error occurred
* Document your debugging process

### 5. Submission Preparation

* Follow the required directory structure
* Properly organize and label AI logs
* In README, explain your approach and AI usage strategy
* Make sure all code runs without errors

---

### Key Takeaways

* AI is your *learning partner*, not your answer machine
* Always explain **why** and **how**
* Show your problem-solving process clearly
* Always link your work to course concepts
* Demonstrate the evolution of your thinking and prompt refinement

---

This test is not just about getting the right answers—it's about demonstrating your problem-solving process and critical thinking. Focus on deepening your understanding through dialogue with AI and clearly expressing what you’ve learned.
